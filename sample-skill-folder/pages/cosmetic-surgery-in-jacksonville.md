### About Us

In 2006, Dr. Erik Nuveen acquired Cosmetic Surgery Affiliates, shaping it into a leading cosmetic surgery practice in Oklahoma City. Dr. Nuveen’s expertise, alongside Dr. Folgeman, expanded CSA’s offerings.

Dr. Nuveen’s wife, Dr. Caplin joined in 2016, specializing in transgender surgery and facial reconstruction. Our Jacksonville-born Dr. Caplin was more than happy to establish the CSA Jax location in her hometown in 2021. CSA Jax quickly gained acclaim, earning accolades for excellence in cosmetic surgery and weight loss services.

I have wanted a reduction with a lift for years. I have always felt like my boobs made me look so much heavier than I was. I had several consultations over the course of a few years and when I met Dr. Caplin I knew she was the one the only one I would trust to do my procedures. She is very professional and honestly makes you feel like one of her girl friends that’s gonna fix your girls. I felt so comfortable and confident with her I would not go anywhere else for anything. From River City Surgery Center’s staff to Wheezie (my CRNA) to GiGi (Dr. Caplins PA) to Dr. Caplim and her staff this is an A+ team that you won’t find anywhere else. Thank you all for making me feel beautiful 🩷🩷🩷🩷

Dr. Caplin is fabulous! I can’t say enough good things about her. She is a caring, empathetic and very skilled plastic surgeon. She recently had to stitch my eye lid emergently. The sutures were so tiny you couldn’t see them! Aftercare for my injury was great. I knew exactly what to do so there would be virtually no scarring. I was so impressed with her that I went to her for another plastic surgery need. There was no high pressure or judgement about what I wanted done. She had only courteous and professional demeanor with great knowledge and experience with my needs. Her office staff, too, is amazing.

[Carolyn Navarro](https://search.google.com/local/reviews?placeid=ChIJdyfdaO1J5IgRn6GfpyPG25I)

I cannot say enough about Dr Caplin and her entire team.

I came to Dr. Caplin after years of discomfort — both physically and emotionally — in my own body. I previously had very large implants (600cc) that were not placed correctly, were falling out of their pockets, and had resulted in significant scar tissue as well as other medical issues. But beyond the technical issues, I never truly identified with my breasts. I never felt comfortable in my skin, and I struggled to articulate what I wanted my chest to look like — I just knew what didn’t feel right.

I had consultations with other surgeons in the area before meeting Dr. Caplin, and those experiences left me discouraged and anxious. Several surgeons were unfamiliar with my goals, dismissive of my concerns, or tried to steer me toward outcomes that didn’t align with how I wanted to feel in my body. I was genuinely afraid of what the outcome of surgery might be.

From the very first visit, Dr. Caplin was different.

She listened — truly listened — to my experience with my body and my chest. I explained that while this was not transgender surgery, I wanted my chest to look and feel more like top surgery, because that is what I identify with and what feels authentic to me. She respected that completely and took my goals seriously, without judgment or assumption.

My surgery included removal of my breasts without implant replacement, along with a tummy tuck and liposuction. During the tummy tuck, Dr. Caplin also identified and repaired two small hernias above my belly button that had never been diagnosed. That level of attentiveness and surgical integrity speaks volumes about her care.

The results are incredible — for the first time, I feel like my chest matches who I am. I feel comfortable, confident, and at home in my body in a way I never did before.

Equally important was the care I received throughout the entire process. Dr. Caplin’s team was compassionate, professional, and supportive every step of the way. I never felt rushed, minimized, or dismissed.

My wife is a Physician Assistant with many years of clinical experience, and she has repeatedly said this is the best surgical care she has ever seen. I couldn’t agree more.

Dr. Caplin didn’t just perform surgery — she gave me the freedom to finally feel like myself. I am deeply grateful and would recommend her without hesitation to anyone seeking thoughtful, skilled, patient-centered surgical care.

Gigi has been doing my Botox and lip filler for awhile now and she is amazing! She always makes me feel comfortable and welcomed each time I go! She does an amazing job and is easy to get along with! I would a 100% suggest her to anyone!

**Response from the owner:** Thank you so much!

Gigi is the best! My appointment felt more like hanging out with a friend than a med spa visit. She’s fun, professional, and truly knows her craft. My results are smooth, refreshed, and gave me exactly the lip inspo I’ve been dreaming of. Highly recommend — no filters needed when Gigi works her magic!

[michelle correll](https://search.google.com/local/reviews?placeid=ChIJdyfdaO1J5IgRn6GfpyPG25I)

Can’t say enough good things about Gigi. She’s extremely skilled and knows exactly what she’s doing. my results are always flawless. Every visit leaves me feeling refreshed, confident, and taken care of. Couldn’t recommend her more!

### FAQs

When you say board-certified, what does that mean?

When a doctor becomes board-certified, it means they’ve gone above and beyond the minimum requirements for their specialty. This involves passing comprehensive exams showcasing their medical, clinical, and diagnostic skills. Our triple board-certified doctors have passed tests for each surgical certification.

Is cosmetic surgery safe?

Although cosmetic surgery adheres to strict national safety standards, it’s crucial to recognize that it still carries risks. Here are some tips to keep in mind while researching cosmetic surgery in Jacksonville:

- Choose a reputable facility: Ensure that the surgical procedure occurs in an accredited ambulatory surgical facility like AAAHC, JACHO, or AAAASF. For instance, our facilities are voluntarily accredited by AAAHC. We have chosen to far exceed the state’s requirements by doing so.
- Research your surgeon: Verify that your surgeon is board-certified and follows preoperative and postoperative instructions.
- Communicate openly: Ask your provider all of your questions during your appointments. Feeling comfortable and confident is key to a successful procedure.

What is WPATH?

WPATH stands for the World Professional Association for Transgender Health. We are very familiar with the WPATH guidelines and standards of care for treating transgender and gender-nonconforming people. We aim to create a supportive and welcoming space at CSA for all those interested in gender reaffirmation surgeries and body and facial contouring.
