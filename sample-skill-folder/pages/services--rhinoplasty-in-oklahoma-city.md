### What is a Rhinoplasty?

Sometimes, our genetics gives us great things from our parents, like beautiful eyes or a strong physique. Other times, our genetics give us things that we might not find beautiful. Having a large nose can make people feel self-conscious about how they look.

At Cosmetic Surgery Affiliates, we provide treatments like a rhinoplasty in Oklahoma City to balance your features and transform your nose.

01

#### Consultation

To truly understand your cosmetic needs, we first schedule you for a consultation with one of our expert doctors. You’ll have the opportunity to talk directly with an expert about your concerns and learn about your treatment options. Together, you’ll talk through each option and choose the best procedure for your goals.

#### Anesthesia

We can provide both IV sedation and general anesthesia for a rhinoplasty in Oklahoma City, so your doctor will talk with you about both those options and help you choose the best one. Once you’ve chosen, they will plan out your procedure with you to ensure they deliver the results you’re looking for.

#### Procedure

Rhinoplasty has varying surgical methods, depending on what is being addressed. The objective during surgery is to remove excess tissue and cartilage or to build and increase cartilage if needed for reshaping. We reshape the nasal features, reform the skin, and drape it over the newly formed framework.

#### Recovery

Once you are out of surgery, your provider will review your post-care instructions again. They will send you home with a prescription to help with the initial swelling and bruising. They will also help you schedule your follow-up appointment to check your progress and ensure everything is healing as planned.

### Rhinoplasty FAQs

Are there nonsurgical alternatives to a rhinoplasty?

If you want to smooth lumps and bumps on your nose, a wrinkle filler might be an option. A filler can temporarily improve minor imperfections, which might help you decide to get a rhinoplasty later on. However, getting a rhinoplasty in Oklahoma City is better for larger changes, long-lasting results, and to adjust the internal structure of your nose for better function.

Will my insurance cover functional nose surgery?

Although rhinoplasty for cosmetic purposes is not paid for by insurance, functional rhinoplasty that is medically necessary to improve your breathing may be covered. If you may be applying for reimbursement from your insurance, please inform a member of our team at your consultation. We can help you submit any needed information and paperwork to your insurance to process your claim.

Can I combine a rhinoplasty with other surgeries?

Some patients think about combining their rhinoplasty in Oklahoma City with another procedure, like cheek or chin augmentation. You can discuss your surgical options with your doctor and create a custom plan that works best for your needs.
