### What are Wrinkle Relaxers?

As time passes, repetitive muscle movements that occur when you smile, laugh, and frown can wear grooves into your skin. These wrinkles—called dynamic wrinkles—can make you look older than you really are and become a source of insecurity. Turn back the clock with wrinkle relaxers!

As their name suggests, wrinkle relaxers allow your facial muscles to rest, smoothing away dynamic wrinkles and refreshing your expression. At Cosmetic Surgery Affiliates, our options for wrinkle relaxers include Jeuveau, Dysport, Daxxify, and Botox in Jacksonville.

### How It Works

**Using small doses of a purified neurotoxin called Botulinum A, wrinkle relaxers interrupt the communication between targeted muscles and your nerves.**

This prevents your muscles from contracting. When used on muscles that cause dynamic wrinkles, wrinkle relaxers can soften wrinkles and prevent new ones from forming.

#### Consultation

Before beginning treatment, you’ll meet with one of our experienced providers. They’ll listen attentively while you explain your aesthetic goals and what you’d like to improve about your appearance. Then, they’ll provide you with surgical and nonsurgical options to help you achieve a look you love.

02

#### Care Plan

You and your provider will work together to create a personalized care plan. We’ll explain each step of your treatment and talk through pre-care and post-care instructions. We’ll also discuss your wrinkle relaxer options like Dysport or Botox in Jacksonville. Once you feel prepared, we will help you schedule your appointments.

03

#### Treatments

To start your wrinkle relaxer treatment, we first cleanse your face. Your provider marks your face for placing the injections. If you have concerns about pain management, we can apply a topical numbing solution. The number of injections and the formula used depends on your care plan and the severity of your wrinkles.

#### Results

After we place your injections, you may experience some mild swelling and bruising at the injection sites. The swelling should resolve shortly, within a few hours, and the bruising within a couple of days. Your results will develop over the next 1 to 2 weeks as the muscles start to relax and your expression softens.

### Wrinkle Relaxer FAQs

What wrinkle relaxer options do you have?

At Cosmetic Surgery Affiliates, we offer Jeuveau, Dysport, Daxxify, and Botox in Jacksonville. Each of these wrinkle relaxers comes with their own formula and benefits. Your provider can direct you to the right relaxer for your cosmetic concerns.

Can I combine Botox with additional aesthetics treatments?

Yes! Our wrinkle relaxers, including Botox, typically pair well with our other nonsurgical anti-aging treatments. For example, if you experience more extensive lines and folds, we can recommend fillers to restore lost volume and smooth creases away. Let us know what cosmetic concerns you’d like to address, and we can recommend options to complement your wrinkle relaxer treatments.

How long will my results last?

The duration of your results depends on your unique skin and the specific wrinkle relaxer used. For most patients, results last 3 to 5 months. We recommend treatments with wrinkle relaxers like Botox in Jacksonville every few months to maintain your revitalized, more youthful look.
