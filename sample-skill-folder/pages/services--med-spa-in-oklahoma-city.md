Medical Weight Loss

By using Semaglutide and/or Tirzepatide, we can imitate the GLP-1 hormone that tells your body that you feel "full". This helps you lose weight quickly, and our team helps you establish habits to keep the weight off.

Wrinkle Relaxers

A purified form of Botulinum toxin type A, our expert providers use wrinkle relaxer injections at our med spa in Oklahoma City to treat crow’s feet, forehead furrows, and dynamic lines between the eyebrows.

Dermal Fillers

Derived from hyaluronic acid, a substance found naturally in the body, the acid holds water in place at the injection site, which corrects moderate-to-severe lines and folds.

Celluma LED Light Therapy

Pioneered by NASA and FDA-cleared, Celluma is an effective and safe treatment that enhances the appearance of patients' skin with blue, red, and near-infrared light therapy.

Facials

Looking for a relaxing skin rejuvenation treatment? We offer exfoliating and hydrating facials that deliver a refreshing glow to your skin.

IPL Photofacial

An IPL Photofacial destroys pigmentation, which causes the skin to begin a self-rejuvenation process. This results in the skin being clearer, more even-toned, and brighter.

Laser Hair Removal

Unwanted hair can be a source of embarrassment, as well as time-consuming, as a person tries to get rid of it through temporary means. We offer laser hair removal at our med spa in Oklahoma City to reduce and eliminate hair.

Laser Skin Resurfacing

Laser skin resurfacing uses advanced laser technology to initiate skin regeneration on the face and neck, to produce a smoother, glowing complexion.

Chemical Peels

Chemical peels are a great way to rejuvenate damaged, unhealthy-looking skin by removing the epidermis in order to initiate skin regeneration.

RF Microneedling

RF Microneedling uses heat to encourage the production of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin to create a tighter, smoother surface.

Dermabrasion

Dermabrasion works by removing damaged skin to start the regeneration of fresh, healthy skin. This improves the tone and texture of your skin, as well as helps with fine lines and wrinkles, scars, and sun damage.

#### Consultation

Before treatment, we schedule you with a one-on-one consultation with one of our expert providers. They listen closely while you describe what concerns you are experiencing and ask questions to truly understand what your goals are. Then, they provide you with both surgical and nonsurgical solutions, explaining each one and how it can benefit you.

02

#### Care Plan

Once you understand your treatment options, you and your provider work together to create a custom treatment plan. You include the options that best suit your needs, and schedule your appointments at our med spa in Oklahoma City. Your provider will then give you all the tools and resources you need to prepare for your treatments.

### Nonsurgical Services FAQs

Can I combine surgical treatments with nonsurgical treatments?

Yes. During your consultation at our med spa in Oklahoma City, your provider will talk with you about all your options for treatment—surgical and nonsurgical. You’ll both work together to create a custom plan that can include both surgical and nonsurgical solutions.

Will I need multiple sessions?

You may need multiple sessions, depending on which treatment you receive. Your provider can tell you how many sessions you will need after you create your custom care plan.

Do you perform surgery and aesthetics in the same building?

While we have surgical suites for some procedures at our med spa in Oklahoma City, we also schedule at additional facilities for more extensive surgeries. However, we perform all our nonsurgical aesthetic treatments at our CSA location in OKC.
