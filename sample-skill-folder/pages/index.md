I recently had brest augmentation surgery and a few years back I had a lower facelift by Dr Nuveen. He did an amazing job both times, he is so kind and takes extreme care with everything he does. He is an amazing surgeon and I would definitely recommend him to anyone I know. His staff were also so nice and I really appreciated that.

**Response from the owner:** Thank you very much for reporting your satisfaction with your surgery and our team! We do try very hard to be the best in the world, not just Oklahoma, and we have the data to support that claim!

Extremely happy with my experience with CSA. Megan, Stephanie, Amber, Hannah, and Candace have provided exceptional care and information regarding my surgery and recovery. Dr Nuveen performed an incredible surgery. Even though I’m less than two weeks post-op, I’m so happy with the results. Thank you so much!

**Response from the owner:** Thank you for your comments. We are grateful for your trust in us and thankful for your positive comments here. We look forward to seeing you again soon.

[Karley Bartlett](https://search.google.com/local/reviews?placeid=ChIJJ5wyw0casocR1DwFd9s4PSA)

f you’re thinking about choosing this clinic, please take a moment to hear my story. I’ve undergone multiple procedures here and am nearly a year post-op. My experience has been nothing but positive, and I would love for my journey to inspire you to feel the same trust and confidence that I do.

After losing 150 pounds, I always dreamed of having my loose skin removed, but I was so nervous to begin the journey. Thanks to Ashley K, I finally found the courage. Ashley is a dear friend of mine, and she has worked here for many years. She was with me every step of the way—holding my hand to calm my nerves before surgery, being there for comfort when I woke up, and her encouraging hugs at every post op appointment have been just what I need. I’ll never be able to thank her enough for the love and encouragement she’s given me. ❤️

Dr. Meyer has completely changed my life. I trusted her with my entire body, and I don’t regret a single thing. She is a perfectionist, and it shows in my results! She has performed a lower body lift, breast lift with augmentation, extended brachioplasty, upper back lift, and axillaplasty for me—done in two separate procedures to prioritize safety and the best possible outcome. Not only is she incredibly skilled, but she also has a heart of gold. She genuinely cares about her patients, takes her time to make you feel comfortable, and is the ultimate hype woman. I adore her!

The staff here is just as exceptional.

Marilyn patiently answered the thousands of questions I had and always made me feel heard. (When I say thousands of questions I MEAN IT. I was alllllot to deal with and she never once made me feel annoying)

Tracy and Phillip, my nurses during surgery, took such good care of me. They knew just how to deal with my nerves and were very good at keeping my husband updated through those long procedures.

Brenda was my nurse at both 24-hour post-ops—she was gentle with bandage removal and explained the healing process so clearly for me and my husband.

Sarah guided me through my augmentation consultation, letting me try on every size until I felt confident. She’s also cared for me post-op with so much kindness and patience.

Every time I leave a post-op appointment, I walk out with more confidence than I had walking in. The entire team celebrates my results right alongside me, and it means the world. Choosing this clinic was the best decision I could have ever made.

**Response from the owner:** Very impressive indeed. Thank you for taking the time to detail your experience with our team at CSA. Our practice thanks
you!

Absolutely recommend Dr. Nuveen! The doctor and the nurses were absolutely compassionate and caring. Their focus on detail and results did not disappoint.

I have wanted a reduction with a lift for years. I have always felt like my boobs made me look so much heavier than I was. I had several consultations over the course of a few years and when I met Dr. Caplin I knew she was the one the only one I would trust to do my procedures. She is very professional and honestly makes you feel like one of her girl friends that’s gonna fix your girls. I felt so comfortable and confident with her I would not go anywhere else for anything. From River City Surgery Center’s staff to Wheezie (my CRNA) to GiGi (Dr. Caplins PA) to Dr. Caplim and her staff this is an A+ team that you won’t find anywhere else. Thank you all for making me feel beautiful 🩷🩷🩷🩷

Dr. Caplin is fabulous! I can’t say enough good things about her. She is a caring, empathetic and very skilled plastic surgeon. She recently had to stitch my eye lid emergently. The sutures were so tiny you couldn’t see them! Aftercare for my injury was great. I knew exactly what to do so there would be virtually no scarring. I was so impressed with her that I went to her for another plastic surgery need. There was no high pressure or judgement about what I wanted done. She had only courteous and professional demeanor with great knowledge and experience with my needs. Her office staff, too, is amazing.

[Carolyn Navarro](https://search.google.com/local/reviews?placeid=ChIJdyfdaO1J5IgRn6GfpyPG25I)

I cannot say enough about Dr Caplin and her entire team.

I came to Dr. Caplin after years of discomfort — both physically and emotionally — in my own body. I previously had very large implants (600cc) that were not placed correctly, were falling out of their pockets, and had resulted in significant scar tissue as well as other medical issues. But beyond the technical issues, I never truly identified with my breasts. I never felt comfortable in my skin, and I struggled to articulate what I wanted my chest to look like — I just knew what didn’t feel right.

I had consultations with other surgeons in the area before meeting Dr. Caplin, and those experiences left me discouraged and anxious. Several surgeons were unfamiliar with my goals, dismissive of my concerns, or tried to steer me toward outcomes that didn’t align with how I wanted to feel in my body. I was genuinely afraid of what the outcome of surgery might be.

From the very first visit, Dr. Caplin was different.

She listened — truly listened — to my experience with my body and my chest. I explained that while this was not transgender surgery, I wanted my chest to look and feel more like top surgery, because that is what I identify with and what feels authentic to me. She respected that completely and took my goals seriously, without judgment or assumption.

My surgery included removal of my breasts without implant replacement, along with a tummy tuck and liposuction. During the tummy tuck, Dr. Caplin also identified and repaired two small hernias above my belly button that had never been diagnosed. That level of attentiveness and surgical integrity speaks volumes about her care.

The results are incredible — for the first time, I feel like my chest matches who I am. I feel comfortable, confident, and at home in my body in a way I never did before.

Equally important was the care I received throughout the entire process. Dr. Caplin’s team was compassionate, professional, and supportive every step of the way. I never felt rushed, minimized, or dismissed.

My wife is a Physician Assistant with many years of clinical experience, and she has repeatedly said this is the best surgical care she has ever seen. I couldn’t agree more.

Dr. Caplin didn’t just perform surgery — she gave me the freedom to finally feel like myself. I am deeply grateful and would recommend her without hesitation to anyone seeking thoughtful, skilled, patient-centered surgical care.

Gigi has been doing my Botox and lip filler for awhile now and she is amazing! She always makes me feel comfortable and welcomed each time I go! She does an amazing job and is easy to get along with! I would a 100% suggest her to anyone!

**Response from the owner:** Thank you so much!

Gigi is the best! My appointment felt more like hanging out with a friend than a med spa visit. She’s fun, professional, and truly knows her craft. My results are smooth, refreshed, and gave me exactly the lip inspo I’ve been dreaming of. Highly recommend — no filters needed when Gigi works her magic!

Can’t say enough good things about Gigi. She’s extremely skilled and knows exactly what she’s doing. my results are always flawless. Every visit leaves me feeling refreshed, confident, and taken care of. Couldn’t recommend her more!

I was at an all time low in life. My breasts were wreaking havoc on my life my back pain was so bad. I was feeling overwhelmed and unsure after several unsuccessful consults with various Doctors I almost wanted to give up even looking for a Dr it was so frustrating. Then like a Godsend a coworker of my husband's recommended Dr Caplin and I haven't looked back since. She is an amazing ???? and absolutely gorgeous Doctor. Her team made everything come together smoothly for us considering we traveled from out of state. The whole team took excellent care of me beginning to end and now I can wake up excited to face a new day without pain. Thanks Dr. Caplin!

Alexa Quinney

Dr. Nuveen and his staff are absolutely amazing. I had 2 breast augmentations with him. My first surgery had a complication afterwards (no fault of Dr. Nuveen, I am just a difficult case) but he did everything to make it right for me. I’m almost 3 months post op on my second surgery and the results are looking better and better each day. I couldn’t recommend them enough!

Kaitlynne Heilaman

I had a rhinoplasty in 2007 that left me hesitant to see another doctor about my nose, but Dr. Nuveen & his staff made this process so easy & comfortable. I'm already thrilled with the results (day 1!) They restored my faith in cosmetic surgery. The staff was so friendly and Dr. Nuveen has incredible bedside manner. I didn't know rhinoplasty could go this well. Thank you all so much for everything you do.

S. Smith

I am extremely pleased with the results of my breast augmentation. Dr. Nuveen and nurse Olivia made the entire process easy and enjoyable!

Vanessa F.

So pleased with everything from the consultation to the surgery to the end results! I was extremely nervous going from a G cup down to aDD lifted and an implant but the girls turned out better than ever!! The staff has been amazing and the doctors were also! Would recommend 10/10


Tanillia R.

Very friendly and professional made me feel at home. This was my 1st time getting my lips done & Botox and everything was perfect. They never tried to push anything on me it was just a very comfortable experience and I definitely will be going back and telling all my friends!!!! Highly recommend this place you won’t be disappointed.
